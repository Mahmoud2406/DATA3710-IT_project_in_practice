/**
 * Wishlist
 *
 * Style templates
 * Allow fonts that aren't in the font list (to support themes with default fonts)
 * Add italic option for fonts
 * Add intelligent defaults for properties
 * Check if the color control already exists and if not create it
 * Behave better when there's already defined colors (eg with Twenty Fifteen)
 * Remove rules containing handlebars (ie with no property set)
 * Add support for child themes - using an 'include' process that allows you to include a theme style file
